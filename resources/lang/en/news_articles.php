                <h2>⚡️ Introduction</h2>
                <p>Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy represents a technology for directly converting solar radiation into electrical energy. PV energy systems vary in design and function to meet different needs, and are primarily classified based on their relationship with the public electricity grid or operational purpose.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>First: Common Basic Components</h2>
                <p>All solar energy systems rely on two essential components to generate electricity:</p>
                <ul class="article-list">
                    <li><strong>PV Panels:</strong> Units consisting of solar cells that absorb photons and convert light energy into direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inverter:</strong> The device responsible for converting the direct current (DC) produced by the panels into alternating current (AC) matching the grid current or household electrical appliances.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>Second: System Classification by Grid Connection</h2>
                <p>Solar power plants are distinguished based on their connection mechanism to the public electricity grid:</p>
                
                <h3>1. On-Grid/Grid-Tied Systems</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The most common systems, operating in complete parallel and integration with the public electricity grid.</p>
                <p><strong>Operation:</strong> Generated energy is consumed directly; if production exceeds consumption, the surplus is exported to the grid and credited to the client via Net Metering.</p>
                <p><strong>Technical Considerations:</strong> Do not contain storage batteries and automatically stop operating when the public grid fails to ensure maintenance crew safety (a protection feature called Anti-islanding).</p>
                
                <h3>2. Off-Grid/Stand-Alone Systems</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Systems designed to operate completely independently, without any connection to the public grid.</p>
                <p><strong>Operation:</strong> Generated energy is first directed to power loads, then surplus is directed to the battery bank, which is the most important element for ensuring continuous power supply at night or on cloudy days.</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> Ideal for remote locations, areas without electrical infrastructure, or those requiring complete independence.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Hybrid Systems</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Advanced solutions combining the advantages of both previous systems: connection to the public grid and battery storage.</p>
                <p><strong>Operation:</strong> The system intelligently determines energy priorities: immediate consumption, battery charging, and exporting surplus to the grid. This system provides backup power capability, automatically switching to battery power in case of grid failure.</p>
                <p><strong>Application:</strong> Used in critical facilities that cannot tolerate power interruptions and require maximum flexibility and security.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>Third: Specialized Applications – Solar Irrigation Systems</h2>
                <p>Solar water pumping systems are one of the important applications based on photovoltaic technology:</p>
                <p><strong>Operation:</strong> Panels generate energy, which is directed via a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) directly to the water pump. The system operates proportionally, where pumping power increases with solar radiation intensity.</p>
                <p><strong>Technical Advantage:</strong> These systems typically don\'t require batteries but rely on direct operation during daylight hours, making them cost-effective and efficient for agricultural sectors.</p>
                <p><strong>Use:</strong> Providing irrigation water, extracting groundwater, and circulating water in farms and remote locations, eliminating the need for diesel generators or distant electrical connections.</p>

                <h2>♨️ Introduction</h2>
                <p>Solar water heaters are a proven engineering solution to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources for water heating. Before considering installing any system, there are basic facts about this technology and its types that any consumer should be aware of.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>1. Basic Principle: Converting Radiation to Heat</h2>
                <p>The core idea of a solar heater is that it\'s a thermal system, not electrical. The main parts work to convert solar radiation into heat, and this heat is transferred and stored in an insulated tank. This means system efficiency depends on available radiation and the thermal insulation quality of collectors and tank.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-section">
                <h2>2. Basic Types of Collectors</h2>
                <p>Choosing between types of solar collectors is not a matter of quality as much as adaptation to climatic and operational conditions.</p>
                
                <div class="comparison-table">
                    <h3>Evacuated Tubes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Performance Advantages:</strong> Very high thermal efficiency. Features superior insulation thanks to air evacuation, reducing heat loss.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimal Application:</strong> Ideal for cold areas or those with large temperature variations. Suitable for facilities requiring high water temperatures (such as hotels and restaurants).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Flat Plate Collectors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Performance Advantages:</strong> Structural durability and relatively lower initial cost. Easy to integrate with building architecture.</p>
                    <p><strong>Optimal Application:</strong> Best option for moderate and sunny areas, where required efficiency is less critical, focusing on durability.</p>
